            <h1>CSS Properties Practice</h1>
        </header>
        <p>In this exercise I am attempting to write some html, and format it using basic css text properties. Hopefully, doing this exercise will give me some practice typing, remembering some of the most common css properties, setting up files and using git.</p> <br>

        <h3>Below are some of the most common css properties and a brief description of what they do...</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><h3>Text-align</h3>
                <p>By default your text will align to the left, just like it does in Word or Google Docs. Using <strong>text-align</strong> you can change it to align to the left, right, center or justify.</li>
            <li><h3>Font-style</h3>
                <p><strong>Font-style</strong> allows you to italicizeyour text. You can either use the words "oblique" or "italic", which will do the same thing.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Font-weight</h3>
                <p>This is the font you will use for creating super light to bold text. You can use the values normal, bold, bolder and lighter or an number value from 100-900.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Text-transform</h3>
                <p>You can use the <strong>text-transform</strong> property to make all of your text change using the following commands: capitlize, uppercase and lowercase.<p></li>
            <li><h3>Font-variant</h3>
                <p>The most common use of <strong>font-variant</strong> is toput text into "small-caps". It is also short hand for other types of font variagtions especially numeric ones such as "slashed-zero".</p></li>
            <li><h3>Text-decoration</h3>
                <p>This property lets you add lines over, under and through your text using the commands: overline, underline and line-through.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Line-height</h3>
                <p>The default for line-height is to be the same as the font-size. You can adjust this by specifing specific pixels, ems, numbers or percentages.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Text-indent</h3>
                <p>This sets the width of the indent at the beginning of a paragraph. It takes pixels, ems or percentages.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Word-spacing</h3>
                <p>This sets the spacing between words, while letter-spacing sets the space between letters. It accepts pixels and ems as well as negative values.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's enough for now! There are about 250 properties and I don't have time to list them all here.</p>
